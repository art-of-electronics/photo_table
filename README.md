Folders contain following files:
1) CAD: table step and stl files for NEMA17 and NEMA23 type stepper motors, 
2) GERB: gerber files for production (upload to JLCPCB and have fun), 
3) Kicad: Kicad 6 project files, so you can fiddle to your hert's content.

I have also uploaded a schematic in pdf file and sample code in micropython for Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266) and Wemos S2 (ESP32) boards in main folder. **Tripple check GPIOs on your version of ESP before uploading the code**
